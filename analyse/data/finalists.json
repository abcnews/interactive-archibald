She trained as an archaeologist at Harvard University and Peking University. Before moving to Australia in 2006, she studied and worked as an art professional in China, America, Japan and Singapore. Intrigued by the Eastern-like background in Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Dapeng Liu had the notion of integrating Chinese and Western forms in one painting. Observing Cao Yin’s skill in melding such concepts, he had his sitter. His challenge was to balance the exquisite detail of classical Chinese landscape painting and the immediacy of Western practice. His background has influences of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) style and of da Vinci. ‘The magnifying glass represents the sitter’s profession, while also symbolising the viewer’s quest for the finer details,’ says Liu. ‘The garment’s hue captures the precious Chinese porcelain of the imperial Ru kiln. Its blue-green tint is the sky after rain in the lower Yangzi River. The elongated figure is redolent of Modigliani and the elegant form pursued by Chinese literati in the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534 CE). In a tribute to his adopted city, Liu includes Sydney’s skyscrapers. Liu is working on his PhD thesis in art history at the University of Sydney. Born in Beijing in 1982, he was trained by his father to sketch from age four. Long fascinated by difference and similarity, he is drawn to blending these two great civilisations on canvas.","year":"2014","rowNumber":2},{"resultnumber":"44","widget":"archibald","dataorigin":"archibald","resultrow":"44","sourcepageurl":"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/2014/29522/","artistname":"Qiang Zhang","artistage":"52","artistlocation":"sydney, New South Wales","style":"impressionist","genderartist":"M","artistethnicity":"Australian-Chinese","subjectname":"Yang Li","gendersubject":"M","subjectoccupation":"Actor","subjectethnicity":"Australian-Chinese","title":"Here","height":"173","width":"193","medium":"oil on canvas","image":"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/media/thumbnails/prize_images/2014ARC_Zhang.jpg.505x450_q85.jpg","description":"Qiang Zhang’s subject Yang Li was a famous actor in China. Since migrating to Australia, he has played a supporting role in the film Mao’s last dancer and appeared in various television programs. ‘This year, when I was once again faced with the question of where I would find my sitter, one of my friends joked and said that I should paint Yang Li,’ says Zhang. ‘It was just a joke at the time but the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. For starters he was bald. Strange as that may sound, for an artist who is more impressionist than detailed in my style, it meant that instead of being limited to only a few shades to articulate the intricate strands of hair, I had to freedom to use a greater spectrum of colours to capture the lighting reflected on a bald head. ‘Furthermore, because I knew Yang Li as a friend I could better capture the non-physical, intangible aspects of my sitter, such as expression and humour, which I feel has added a greater depth and dimension to my work.’ Born in Dalian, China in 1962, Zhang graduated from the Luxun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang. He migrated to Australia in 1990 and set aside his passion for painting for a decade in order to care for his family.

It’s all repackaged and sent out into the world where it is evaluated, absorbed and informs the next generation. He becomes an influence – or if they saw him, maybe a pivotal moment in their lives – and the process just keeps rolling along, repeating endlessly. ‘So the painting represents an imaginary rock opera made in 1983 when Cave was 26 years old, the same age as Orson Welles when he made Citizen Kane in 1941. But it’s about a modern-day media tycoon, Rupert Murdoch rather than William Randolph Hearst. I see Cave and Welles as similar, extraordinary talents, across multiple disciplines.’ Born in Sydney in 1966, this is the fourth time Powditch has been an Archibald Prize finalist.

Although contemporary artists typically represent the outside world, they are often afflicted by moments of isolation,’ says Natasha Bieniek. ‘My self-portrait, Isola, which translates as “island” in Italian, aims to reflect on the parallel roles that seclusion and exposure play within the life of a painter. ‘Self-representation is a consistently explored subject both in contemporary culture and throughout art history. Whether this is demonstrated by the social-media trend of the uploaded “selfie”, or with an oil painting that examines personal consciousness, the self-portrait addresses not only individual presence but also inevitably encompasses the reflection of the observer. ‘The small nature of my painting invites the viewer to inspect the work at close proximity. My aim is to form a one-on-one relationship that provokes intimacy. Composed within a vast emptiness of space, my self-portrait resembles qualities similar to a still-life painting, translating the figure into an object of observation. Isola endeavours to form a juncture between solitude, self-representation and public exposure.’ Born in Melbourne in 1984, Bieniek has been a finalist in the Archibald Prize for the past four consecutive years.

Before her first sitting for Phillip Barnes, she undertook a program to help identify key crossroads in her life. She kept coming back to her absolute need to put everything else out of her mind to concentrate on the task at hand. Only by narrowing her focus is she able to compete and achieve at the level she does. ‘The transformation that comes over her when she slips on her race helmet is startling, if not intimidating,’ says Barnes. ‘That transformation is the central theme of the portrait. Almost assaulted by her stare, the viewer is hopefully transfixed long enough to allow the eye to wander back through the layers into Anna’s past where some of these references to life’s crossroads are hidden.’ The work features a visual movement from the technicolour collection of words, numbers and symbols towards a focused monochromatic depiction of Meares. ‘This moves Anna’s traumatic story to the background and places the viewer on the starting line with her moments before she launches,’ says Barnes.

Morpheus is the Greek god of dreams and sleep, hence the title of the work. Like the dreams of sleep, anaesthetic dreams are fleeting and easily forgotten but give us an insight into the patient’s state of awareness during anaesthesia. ‘I was fascinated by Kate Leslie’s work and saw this portrait as an opportunity to depict the mystery of general anaesthesia,’ says Andrew Mezei. ‘I painted Kate with opium poppies, as tools of her trade. Through her gesture, we are submerged into the unconscious and by distorting the pebbles below I tried to capture that strange sense of disjointed time that occurs as we wake. Occasionally, fleeting dreams swim across our minds, and while we are at our most vulnerable the anaesthetist stands guard, sheltering the fragile mind and shielding us from the intolerable.’ Born in Melbourne in 1963, Mezei is the son of Hungarian refugees. His parents ran a leather goods workshop steeped in a culture of fine European craftsmanship. That tradition is reflected in Andrew’s work; he grinds his own pigments and employs techniques from the Dutch Baroque period to create luminous paintings.

Suspension, levitation and the possibility of transcendence, suggested in ways that are magical and illusory, have been constant themes in his work, as has the denial of this possibility. His recent performances – in which he works closely with dancers, musicians and technicians – are highly dramatic, incorporating complex personal narratives and staging. He is currently rehearsing a new work at his studio/performance space, during which the sittings for this painting took place. A long-time admirer, Mathew Lynn only recently met Unsworth. This took place in the rainforest below Katoomba at the unveiling of Unsworth’s sculpture Harlequin’s shuttle, commissioned in conjunction with the 2014 Scenic World Sculpture Award. The combination of seeing this work, which Lynn describes as ‘miraculous’, and their meeting, had a great effect on him. Lynn refers to Fragonard’s famous Rococo painting (with a further reference to Morandi’s flowers) as a way of suggesting Unsworth’s playfulness, mischief and sense of the dramatic. These sources are re-formed into a narrative that is implied through Unsworth’s body and face with its accumulation of a life, loaded with restrained energy, yet surging with precarious possibility and mortality. Born in Sydney in 1963, Lynn has been an Archibald Prize finalist 14 times.

This regard for tradition is tempered by a recognition of the need to avoid predictability and cliché. The balance each of us seeks between thought and feeling in our work is what gives Sarah’s performances such complexity and depth. ‘I am wary of portraiture but it fascinates me. Social ambition and the pursuit of likeness can defeat painting but humans are endlessly interesting.

Easier said than done,’ says Benjamin. ‘I approach my portraits like sculpture, hence the scale. I start with quick impressions of the subject. Not sketches, whole pieces, then I chip away. In Tim’s case I went in all guns blazing with the swagger and wink of the man I had seen on stage. No version worked.

A sensitive observer of our natural landscapes, intrepid explorer and photographer, he was captivated by dramatic mountain scenery. He is remembered for his sunset-hued depictions of the natural environment. ‘I can relate,’ says Juan Ford. ‘Recently, as a homage, I attempted to channel his vision. I soon realised that this was an impossible and patently absurd thing to do. Naturally, the next best thing is to make a painting about the absurdity of trying to do this in the first place. It’s part tribute, part folly, part self-portrait.’ Ford’s practice is interdisciplinary, ranging from painting to installation. A constant theme in his work centres around observations and inquiry into humanity’s relationship with the natural environment. A great deal of his painting has involved an active engagement with the Australian art canon in an original and subversive manner. Born in 1973, Ford lives and works in Melbourne.

They were making a lot of noise, laughing and playing Norwegian wood. It was great to meet the man I had watched on Play school, now far removed from Big Ted,’ says Julian Meagher. Waters is an English-born actor who has lived in Australia since 1968. He is also an accomplished musician, and since 1992 has toured many times with Looking through a glass onion. Co-created with D’Arrietta, the production is a tribute to John Lennon’s life through music. With permission from Yoko Ono, they are taking the show to New York this October. ‘I wanted to paint John in a puffy shirt, both as a nod to his theatrical profession and to re-imagine him as a kind of colonial character,’ says Meagher. ‘He has such a strong face, which really suited my painting style. I hoped to capture an intense, complex expression. Rather than looking back at the viewer, he is engaged with something outside our understanding.’ Born in Sydney in 1978, Meagher left work as a medical doctor nine years ago to paint full-time. He studied the atelier method in Florence.

The players are familiar, yet also enigmatic, as we all are to each other. ‘In the 21st century most of us assume multiple identities, a little like playing cards.

My self-portrait is about all these things: my passage from a young boy desperately wanting to play at the adult’s table to a middle-aged man with a weathered face. ‘I painted myself in a hat and patterned shirt as I have a large collection of both. The pork pie hat is the kind of flash thing my father would have worn, connecting my older self with the young man he once was. I look across the table with the guarded, questioning countenance shared by lawyers and card players.’ Mallam is a practising lawyer, a director of the Australian World Orchestra and is currently studying at the National Art School.

He contacted Zavros about painting him for the 2014 Archibald Prize and was invited to his studio. ‘When I started planning to make a painting of Michael I wanted it to be completely about him and not about the luxury goods and clothing that he has become renowned for painting,’ says Wise. ‘I wanted his face to fill the canvas as this helped lose any distractions and concentrate entirely on the sitter. I wanted the portrait to draw the viewer in and focus on his eyes.’ Zavros’s grandfather moved to Australia from Cyprus and was called Zavros as a nickname, meaning ‘lefty’ or left-handed, which the family then adopted as their surname. ‘I have paid homage to this by making the left side of his face dominant in the composition,’ says Wise. Born in the UK in 1975, Wise lives on the Gold Coast. An artisan for over 20 years, he started painting around five years ago. He works by using multiple layers of opaque and transparent paint.

Flowing from this, the choice of myself as subject for this work was obvious,’ says Michael Bales. ‘The painting explores issues relating to the artist himself and to Australian society more broadly. In both cases the whole is made of individual parts, which need to work together to be effective. ‘The butchered body, with the butcher posing over the half completed job, raises many questions. When we look at ourselves, how do we perceive the condition of our body? What lurks beneath the external veneer? When we look at our society, how do we view its current condition, and its future direction?

Salvatore Zofrea was drawn to paint her having seen her frequently in the media. ‘She has a very striking appearance, marvellous bone structure and a very friendly smile,’ he says. ‘When the time came to paint her, I decided to draw on my experience in making woodblock prints – in other words, to use bold outlines, which conveyed her strength of character, unique features and her down-to-earth, practical approach to life. ‘The light cobalt dress Ms Berejiklian selected for the sittings inspired me to choose a resonant lemon-yellow for the background. The sitter’s posture, leaning slightly forward in the chair, is indicative of her self-contained strength and strong sense of purpose. She seems to be listening intently to someone and giving them her full attention. This is what, in my view, gives the portrait its strength: her large, compelling eyes make direct contact with the viewer who is drawn into the portrait. The expression in those eyes is the heart and soul of the painting.’ Born in Italy in 1946, Zofrea came to Australia in 1956.

So it’s a bit of a take on the farmer-like figures out there. ‘It’s that grain field style of painting and, of course, I would have looked at other grain field painters like Sidney Nolan.

Cleaver Greene is a contemporary portrait of the wild colonial boy. A larrikin, drunk, womaniser and dandy, he falls somewhere between hero and anti-hero.

It is this image, in addition to the sketches made both backstage and from my seat in the audience that evening, on which the painting is based. The result has, to quote Humphries’ response upon seeing the finished painting, achieved a “more than flattering likeness”. ‘The portrait takes its composition form Max Beckmann’s Self portrait in tuxedo 1927, chosen because of Humphries’ interest in Weimar culture. The work of both men combines unsentimental insight and sharp satire to comment on the contemporary society of their respective eras. Where the Beckmann self-portrait conveys a sense of assurance, this painting reveals insight into the man as he moves between roles from stage to sitter.

She had an orchestral career and worked in music therapy before moving into radio in 2001. She still plays the viola. ‘My work habits led to my choice of subject for this year’s Archibald Prize,’ says Tighe. ‘Starting at 6am every morning in my studio, my companion is Emma Ayres on the radio. Her voice is often the first I hear each weekday. ‘This painting was completed in my head before I met Emma. At our first meeting, it was as though she was in tune with my idea. The kaffiyeh scarf she was wearing resonated with me. I also wanted to paint Emma’s hands. Hands are often overlooked or avoided by portrait artists but they are such an expressive, important part of the subject and their work. This portrait is not about a face, but a person. I also felt I wanted to bring Emma to life because, for many, she is someone heard but not seen. Born in Melbourne in 1965, Tighe is a self-taught artist who began painting at age 30. He has painted many subjects from Australian history and folklore including Ronald Ryan (the last man hanged in Australia) and the story of Picnic at Hanging Rock. He has entered the Archibald Prize on seven occasions; this is the first time he has been selected.","year":"2014","rowNumber":46},{"resultnumber":"47","widget":"archibald","dataorigin":"archibald","resultrow":"47","sourcepageurl":"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/2014/29472/","artistname":"Mike Barnard","artistage":"41","artistlocation":"sydney, New South Wales","style":"impressionist","genderartist":"M","artistethnicity":"caucasian","subjectname":"Judy Barnard","gendersubject":"F","subjectoccupation":"unknown","subjectethnicity":"caucasian","title":"You beautiful fighter","height":"50","width":"50","medium":"oil on MDF","image":"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/media/thumbnails/prize_images/2014ARC_Barnard.jpg.505x507_q85.jpg","description":"Mike Barnard’s subject is his mother Judy who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in her cheek at age 61. ‘Capturing mum’s grace and humility during seven years of treatment was something I’d thought a lot about,’ says Barnard. ‘Although she was stoic, it was a constant struggle for her. You knew that at times she was prevailing and at other times the illness was prevailing. ‘The ravages of cancer are obscene. It’s a crudeness that surpasses representation. So I imagined her illness not in literal terms, but in the treatment I gave to the work: an erasing, a paring back of material and form that was its own form of violation. At the same time, I wanted her grace to ring through. The central ambiguity of the painting is that her profile is neither inscribed on a background nor subjugated by a foreground, but is somewhere in between. That’s really what the painting is about. This beautiful fighter may not be triumphant, but she’s certainly undiminished. ‘Finishing the work in January 2014 was bittersweet. Mum died on 3 March 2014.’ Born in Sydney in 1973, Barnard’s practice is painting-based but includes photography, sculpture, print and video work. His paintings are often ambiguous or disquieting, made with a limited palette of muted colours painted using a soft-brush technique that makes the image appear to ‘float’, to emerge and recede. This is his first Archibald Prize entry.","year":"2014","rowNumber":47},{"resultnumber":"48","widget":"archibald","dataorigin":"archibald","resultrow":"48","sourcepageurl":"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/2014/29493/","artistname":"Alan Jones","artistage":"37","artistlocation":"sydney, New South Wales","style":"expressionist","genderartist":"M","artistethnicity":"caucasian","subjectname":"Adam Goodes","gendersubject":"M","subjectoccupation":"sportsperson","subjectethnicity":"Indigenous Australian","title":"Adam","height":"171","width":"156","medium":"oil and acrylic on linen","image":"http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/media/thumbnails/prize_images/2014ARC_Jones.jpg.505x553_q85.jpg","description":"In 2014, Adam Goodes broke the record for most AFL games played by an Indigenous footballer. This honour was added to his long list of accolades as a dual Brownlow Medallist, dual premiership winner, four-time All-Australian, member of the Indigenous Team of the Century, and Australian representative in the International Rules Series. In 2014, he was named Australian of the Year for his community work through the GO Foundation and his advocacy against racism. ‘I have wanted to paint Adam’s portrait for years,’ says Alan Jones. ‘I’m a big Swans supporter and Adam is a champion of the game. I have enormous respect for the strength and integrity he shows both on and off the field.’ ‘I chose to paint a dual portrait to convey the many facets of Adam’s life. I wanted to capture his warm, gentle nature quite separately to the footballer fans see each week. Adam is an amazing athlete but also so much more than that: he is a son, a brother, an extremely proud Indigenous Australian (Adnyamathanha and Narungga on his mother’s side), an active campaigner for constitutional recognition and a great role model in so many ways.’ Born in Sydney in 1977, Jones was awarded the prestigious Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship in 2004.

Access was granted. ‘Saville Row tailors say “certain men are moving targets” and Sir Les is no exception,’ says Tim Storrier. ‘During our long sittings, I attempted to keep him engaged with his tipple and cigarettes. To paint such a dynamic, thrusting personality with the sensitivity that a personage of his flamboyance deserves, I drew on my knowledge of historic portraits of great men of destiny. In portraying our revered elder statesman, retired politician, former chairman of the Cheese Board and our most celebrated cultural ambassador, I found a strange resemblance to Sir Leslie’s manager Humphries. ‘There were subtle technical difficulties in arranging the deportment of Sir Les’s trousers. His pretty, young assistant often strutted into the room and I would have to rearrange the lights so his enthusiasm in her presence was not as pronounced. After the final sitting, his parting words to me were: “you are probably not a bad little dauber Timbo but not in the league of the great Pro (Hart)”.’ Born in Sydney in 1949, Storrier studied at the National Art School and now lives and works in Bowral.

Photography is an integral part of Maguire’s painting process. He takes a photo, adjusts it digitally and then, using scans of the adjusted image in each of the three primary printing colours – yellow, magenta and cyan – he builds up the image in transparent layers of paint based on these ‘colour separations’. After painting each layer, he sprays the work with a diluted solvent, which creates random mixes of colour. ‘Capturing the right photo of Cate was tricky,’ he says. ‘I wanted something un-posed and natural, as if she were unaware of the camera. I took numerous photographs, before finding the right one. The subsequent challenge was to find a way to build up the layers of paint without losing the wonderful luminosity of her complexion. ‘The left panel is made of very thin painted layers of yellow and magenta. By leaving out the cyan I was better able to preserve the white of the canvas, and thus the lightness and transparency that I was seeking. In the right panel, the addition of cyan completes the spectrum, adding density and richness.’ Born in the UK in 1958, Maguire arrived in Australia in 1959.

Jandamarra Cadd is an Aboriginal (Yorta Yorta) man who was introduced to the paintbrush at age 15 after a troubled childhood growing up as an outsider in his own land.

Its blue-green tint is the sky after rain in the lower Yangzi River. The elongated figure is redolent of Modigliani and the elegant form pursued by Chinese literati in the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534 CE). In a tribute to his adopted city, Liu includes Sydney’s skyscrapers. Liu is working on his PhD thesis in art history at the University of Sydney. Born in Beijing in 1982, he was trained by his father to sketch from age four. Long fascinated by difference and similarity, he is drawn to blending these two great civilisations on canvas."},"gsx$year":{"$t":"2014"}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1p0GPaaAa6uFuSwUh2x6GMY2yYNPH3pWxYRpZuTP3i1c/out7llt/public/values/cre1l"},"updated":{"$t":"2014-07-16T01:21:56.905Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#list"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"44"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"widget: archibald, dataorigin: archibald, resultrow: 44, sourcepageurl: http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/archibald/2014/29522/, artistname: Qiang Zhang, artistage: 52, artistlocation: sydney, New South Wales, style: impressionist, genderartist: M, artistethnicity: Australian-Chinese, subjectname: Yang Li, gendersubject: M, subjectoccupation: Actor, subjectethnicity: Australian-Chinese, title: Here, height: 173, width: 193, medium: oil on canvas, image: http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/media/thumbnails/prize_images/2014ARC_Zhang.jpg.505x450_q85.jpg, description: Qiang Zhang’s subject Yang Li was a famous actor in China.

A World War II veteran, he helped establish the heritage and conservation movement in Australia. In 2013, he was awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). Many years ago, Mirra Whale’s mother invited Uren to talk to her primary school pupils about war, peace and forgiveness. ‘She spoke so fondly and highly of him that I wanted to paint him, so she offered to introduce us,’ says Whale. ‘We sat at his Balmain home, drank tea and told stories. As I was leaving, I asked Tom if there was anything I could do for him or bring for my next visit. He smiled, took my hand, and replied, “just take my warmth and joy with you”.

A sensitive observer of our natural landscapes, intrepid explorer and photographer, he was captivated by dramatic mountain scenery. He is remembered for his sunset-hued depictions of the natural environment. ‘I can relate,’ says Juan Ford. ‘Recently, as a homage, I attempted to channel his vision. I soon realised that this was an impossible and patently absurd thing to do. Naturally, the next best thing is to make a painting about the absurdity of trying to do this in the first place. It’s part tribute, part folly, part self-portrait.’ Ford’s practice is interdisciplinary, ranging from painting to installation. A constant theme in his work centres around observations and inquiry into humanity’s relationship with the natural environment. A great deal of his painting has involved an active engagement with the Australian art canon in an original and subversive manner. Born in 1973, Ford lives and works in Melbourne.

A sensitive observer of our natural landscapes, intrepid explorer and photographer, he was captivated by dramatic mountain scenery. He is remembered for his sunset-hued depictions of the natural environment. ‘I can relate,’ says Juan Ford. ‘Recently, as a homage, I attempted to channel his vision. I soon realised that this was an impossible and patently absurd thing to do. Naturally, the next best thing is to make a painting about the absurdity of trying to do this in the first place. It’s part tribute, part folly, part self-portrait.’ Ford’s practice is interdisciplinary, ranging from painting to installation. A constant theme in his work centres around observations and inquiry into humanity’s relationship with the natural environment. A great deal of his painting has involved an active engagement with the Australian art canon in an original and subversive manner. Born in 1973, Ford lives and works in Melbourne. He has a Master of Arts by research from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. He has had 29 solo exhibitions since 1998 and has participated in over 100 group exhibitions, including projects in Manifesta 9, the European Biennale of Contemporary Art in Belgium, 2012, and Melbourne now at the National Gallery of Victoria, 2013.

In the last year I have been really concentrating on it again,’ he says. ‘I find myself strangely attracted to the landscape with its big, flat plains. I find it exhilarating. So it’s a bit of a take on the farmer-like figures out there. ‘It’s that grain field style of painting and, of course, I would have looked at other grain field painters like Sidney Nolan. I wanted a single figure in that landscape. I like to keep my figurative work going. A year ago I did a series of self-portrait heads so it’s on-going.’ Furlonger says that in this painting he was primarily concerned with capturing the feel of the place. ‘I gave up some of the realism, with more emphasis on the feel of the place than any physiological aspects. It’s like those portraits where the setting and the background have the meaning.’ Born in Cairns in 1952, Furlonger is one of Australia’s leading landscape artists.

In the last year I have been really concentrating on it again,’ he says. ‘I find myself strangely attracted to the landscape with its big, flat plains. I find it exhilarating. So it’s a bit of a take on the farmer-like figures out there. ‘It’s that grain field style of painting and, of course, I would have looked at other grain field painters like Sidney Nolan. I wanted a single figure in that landscape. I like to keep my figurative work going. A year ago I did a series of self-portrait heads so it’s on-going.’ Furlonger says that in this painting he was primarily concerned with capturing the feel of the place. ‘I gave up some of the realism, with more emphasis on the feel of the place than any physiological aspects. It’s like those portraits where the setting and the background have the meaning.’ Born in Cairns in 1952, Furlonger is one of Australia’s leading landscape artists. He won the Fleurieu Art Prize for landscape painting in 2002 and the Moet & Chandon Fellowship in 1988 as a result of which he spent a year in France.

Within this small and intimate space I wanted the viewer to feel very close to him, as if engaged in a private conversation. The clarity of the fine brushwork, the building up of crosshatched marks and small washes of transparent colour that refine and adjust the surface are most important.

Within this small and intimate space I wanted the viewer to feel very close to him, as if engaged in a private conversation. The clarity of the fine brushwork, the building up of crosshatched marks and small washes of transparent colour that refine and adjust the surface are most important. The strength of the portrait, I believe, lies in the moment of engagement between viewer and subject.’ Miller was born in Canada and came to Australia in 1987 to undertake a Master of Fine Arts degree at the Centre for the Arts, University of Tasmania.
