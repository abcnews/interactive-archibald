<a name="colour"> </a><h2>Colour</h2><p>Reflecting their traditional style, the early winners are dominated by dark moody backgrounds and skin tones, with blue a very common highlight colour.</p><p>Recent years have seen much more adventurous use of colour, and this year's finalists are no exception.</p><a name="style"> </a><h2>Style</h2><p>From its beginnings in 1921, the Archibald focused on more traditional forms of painting and was dominated by tonal realist-style paintings. As time progressed winners of differing styles were - sometimes controversially - accepted.</p><p>One of the key rules is that the portrait be painted from life, and no direct copies from photographs are allowed. Even at the time the prize was founded, photography was often used by artists in the process of creating their works, but a subject sitting for the artist remains a prerequisite.</p><p>In recent years expressionist-style works have been the most successful, but the prize remains a fairly conservative interpretation of the term portrait.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5597784/data/style-data.png" alt="Style" title="Style" width="414" height="220">
<blockquote><p>The first challenge to the traditional form of painting came from three-time winner William Dobell in 1943 with his portrait of artist and friend Joshua Smith. The win was subject to a court challenge from two other Archibald artists who claimed it was a caricature, not a portrait. </p><p>While the courts ruled in favour of Dobell, the resulting furore was devastating for those involved. It spelt the end of the friendship between Dobell and Smith, and saw Dobell leave Sydney to escape the media attention</p></blockquote><a name="medium"> </a><h2>Medium</h2><p>Despite some early watercolour entries when it comes to the Archibald, oil is king. While acrylic paint became commercially available in the 1950s it didn't make an appearance amongst the winners until 1973. </p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5597790/data/medium-data.png" alt="Medium" title="Medium" width="575" height="230">
<p>The past 20 years have seen a broadening of the materials used, with a watercolour winning in 2002 and - somewhat controversially - charcoal used in the 2004 winner, however oil remains the most popular medium.</p><p>Craig Ruddy's winning 2004 portrait of David Gulpilil was subjected to a court challenge by a fellow artist, who claimed it was a drawing and not a painting.</p><blockquote><p>By far the most creative use of materials in a winner was by Brett Whiteley in his triptych Art, Life and the other thing, which won the Archibald in 1978.</p><p>Whiteley used 'oil paint, a glass eye, hair, pen and ink on cardboard, plaster, photography, oil-dried PV, cigarette butts, and hypodermic syringe on board,' to create the work, which referenced his previous win and his addiction to heroin, an addiction that would later take his life.</p></blockquote><a name="subjectoccupation"> </a><h2>Subject occupation</h2><p>While actors and musicians have featured prominently in the past 20 years, the overwhelming way to fast track your portrait to victory is to paint another artist.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5597796/data/subject-occupation-data.png" alt="Subject Occupation" title="Subject Occupation" width="460" height="422">
<blockquote><p>The prize was established by Bulletin founder JF Archibald as a way of fostering portraiture in Australia and perpetuating the memory of the great Australians. </p><p>It is awarded to a portrait 'preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in art, letters, science or politics, painted by any artist resident in Australasia'. </p><p>The term preferentially means the <a href="http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/about-us/people/agnsw-trust/" target="_blank" title="">trustees of the Art Gallery of NSW</a>, who pick the prize, have the discretion to award it to subjects who may not be considered notable in their own right.</p></blockquote><a name="subjectgender"> </a><h2>Subject gender</h2><p>While a painting featuring a woman won the Archibald just two years after its inception, only 13 winners in the past 93 years have been of women, and of those four were in the first decade.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5597774/data/subject-gender-data.png" alt="Subject Gender" title="Subject Gender" width="588" height="124">
<p>This imbalance has lessened recently with portraits of women making up five of the last 20 winners.</p><blockquote><p>The first painting to win with a female subject was just three years into the competition, while the first female artist to win the Archibald was Nora Heysen in 1938, with her portrait of Madame Elink Schuurman, the wife of the Consul General for the Netherlands. </p><p>In response, Australian art icon Max Meldrum - himself an Archibald winner - said: "If I were a woman, I would certainly prefer raising a healthy family to a career in art. Women are more closely attached to the physical things of life. They are not to blame. They cannot help it, and to expect them to do some things equally as well as men is sheer lunacy."</p></blockquote><a name="artistgender"> </a><h2>Artist gender</h2><p>The Archibald's record of rewarding female artists is even more lopsided, with only seven female artists winning the prize nine times in total.</p><p>Four of those wins have been in the past 20 years.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5597764/data/artist-gender-data.png" alt="Artist Gender" title="Artist Gender" width="599" height="131">
<blockquote><p>All eligible entries between 1921 and 1945 were shown at the gallery, but curators gradually reduced the exhibition to actual finalists. </p><p>This means it is hard to assess whether the lack of female winners is due to a lack of female entrants.</p><p>However records of individual years show women have a long history being represented both as artists and subjects. In the second year of the competition, 13 of the 53 entries were painted by women, and in 1968, 57 of the 141 entries were by women.</p><p>In contrast in 1970 - the first year of the finalist-only exhibits - only two of the 15 chosen finalists were painted by women.</p></blockquote><a name="subjectethnicity"> </a><h2>Ethnicity</h2><p>The seven non-caucasian artists among this year's finalists are up against the weight of history, with no winning artists who identify as being from any other ethnic background.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5597772/data/artist-ethnicity-data.png" alt="Artist Ethnicity" title="Artist Ethnicity" width="585" height="60">
<p>Similarly, while 11 of the finalists are of non-caucasian subjects, only three winning portraits in the history of the prize have been of non-caucasian subjects: Indigenous artist Albert Namatjira, Indigenous actor David Gulpilil, and Indigenous musician Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5597780/data/subject-ethnicity-data.png" alt="Subject Ethnicity" title="Subject Ethnicity" width="554" height="74">
<blockquote><p>The fact that neither the artist or subject ethnicity is required on the entry form - and the changing nature of how the the prize is displayed - means, as with gender, the ethnicity of subjects and artists who were displayed or among the finalists is impossible to determine. </p><p>However Indigenous subjects have a long history of representation, starting in 1924 with icon David Unaipon, who features on the $50 note.</p><p>Since the selection of finalists 13 Indigenous artists have been included, including Robert Campbell Jnr in 1989 and 1990, Julie Dowling in 2001 and 2002, Richard Bell in 2004 (who is a subject in this year's finalists) and Weaver Jack in 2006.</p><p>Jack's self-portrait in the form of a landscape sparked controversy because it challenged traditional concepts of portraiture.</p></blockquote><a name="artistage"> </a><h2>Artist age</h2><p>The golden decade for winning the Archibald seems to be between 35 and 44; 40 per cent of winners fall within this demographic, and the most common winner is aged 35.</p><p>This year's finalists line up fairly closely with the winners, with a third in the ideal range.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5600158/data/age-data.png" alt="Age" title="Age" width="418" height="202">
<p>If finalist Jason Phu (born in 1989) takes out the top prize, he will become the youngest ever winner, taking over from the first female winner Nora Heyson. She was just 27 when she won in 1938.</p><blockquote><p>The honour of being the oldest Archibald winner goes to John Olsen, who was 77 when he won with a self portrait in 2005. </p><p>Olsen's first brush with Archibald fame came when he was part of a protest against the decision to award the 1953 prize to William Dargie. </p><p>The Sunday Herald breathlessly reported on the protest, which saw clashes between art students and gallery attendants, writing - 'They wore corduroy trousers. Most of the men had beards&nbsp;and long hair... only one,&nbsp;John&nbsp;Olsen, revealed his name'.</p></blockquote><a name="artistlocation"> </a><h2>Artist location</h2><p>Not surprisingly for a competition run by the New South Wales Art Gallery, that state's painters make up the largest proportion of the winners.</p><p>However the long reigns of Victorian artists WB McInnes and William Dargie, with six and seven wins respectively, ensure the Sydney-Melbourne rivalry remains vibrant.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5597788/data/artist-location-data.png" alt="Artist Location" title="Artist Location" width="365" height="297">
<blockquote><p>Every year the finalists and eventual winner are chosen by the <a href="http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/about-us/people/agnsw-trust/" target="_blank" title="">Art Gallery of New South Wales' Board of Trustees</a>, which views every entry in person.</p><p>As the board is made up of people from different walks of life (including artists) and not art critics, the Prize is considered more reflective of the views of the general public.</p></blockquote><a name="canvassize"> </a><h2>Canvas size</h2><p>While recently the prize is associated with large-scale paintings, overall winners tend to be a much more modest size.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5603500/data/size-data.png" alt="Size" title="Size" width="470" height="244">
<p>However when looking at winners from the past 20 years, canvas size more than doubles to almost 3.5 square metres on average, showing a possible preference from the judges for larger paintings.</p><p>This year's finalists are more in line with the overall trend, coming in at just over 2 square metres on average.</p><blockquote><p>The trend towards large paintings reached fever pitch in 2002, when Cherry Hood's watercolour, Simon Tedeschi unplugged, took out the top prize at over 6 square metres.</p><p>Hood's was among many large paintings entered that year, prompting the organisers to impose a size limitation of 9 square metres, as "excessively large works created handling, judging and storing difficulties, as well as restricting the number that could fit in the exhibition".</p></blockquote><a name="aspectratio"> </a><h2>Aspect ratio</h2><p>Unsurprisingly for a portrait prize, the portrait ratio has dominated the winners.</p><p>Despite the prize embracing different styles of portrait in recent times, in this respect it remains traditional, with only two landscape and three square paintings among the winners of the last 20 years.</p>
  <img src="http://www.abc.net.au/news/linkableblob/5600850/data/orientation-data.png" alt="Orientation" title="Orientation" width="599" height="183">
<blockquote><p>Once again it is up to Brett Whiteley to overcome the odds. His first win was a landscape that raised eyebrows due to the tiny proportion of the painting devoted to his face, while his second win was a triptych of three paintings. This must give hope to Tim Maguire, who submitted a diptych of actress Cate Blanchett this year</p></blockquote><a name="conclusion"> </a><h2>Results</h2><p>So here they are, the portraits most similar to previous winners. Jason Benjamin’s realist portrait of You Am I frontman Tim Rogers would continue a recent trend for portraits of entertainers, and his move from Melbourne to Sydney may prove the difference.</p><p>While Peter Churcher's Four self-portraits in a bunch of balloons may not seem an obvious choice, self-portraits have won 17 times, and Troy Quinliven's portrait of fellow artist &nbsp;Rodney Pople also ticks a lot of boxes. Although, at 30, Quinliven sits outside the golden decade of winners.</p><p>Using statistics to predict something as subjective as an art prize may be a folly, so <a href="/news/2014-07-17/poll-which-painting-is-your-pick-to-win-the-2014-archibald-prize/5603886" target="_self" title="">tell us who you think should take out the Archibald tomorrow.</a></p><blockquote><p>The information used for this interactive was provided by the Art Gallery of New South Wales.
